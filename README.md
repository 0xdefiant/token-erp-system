# Supply Chain with Token incentive

## Thesis - Tokenization == Market Efficiency
With the current regulatory environment, there seems to be no limit as to what token, and what actions we can take on-chain-- but there seems to only be value deriven from memes and ai agent hype. There is no real use case that has driven the asset values of tokens and the crypto space up, it's only greater fools theory driving growth. There's no real 'gdp' effect coming from the space.

Payments are backed into blockchains, therefore stablecoins usage will increase, as people look for liquidity after this pump cycle (people selling their meme coins). From these profits, new economic activity will spark for payments to occur on-chain for goods and services.

The goods and services data lives in silos, known as ERP systems like SAP, NetSuite and countless others. These systems are useful to people, and the barrier to entry for the ERP space has not been touched, as encumbents run the show and the cost to switch systems is extreme, typically costing hundreds of thousands in fee's for accountants and IT specialists to craft solutions and match data from pre and post conversion states.

Because of this impossibility, most of the integrations with blockchains are through API's that connect to ERPs and then the blockchain transactions occur in a silo. For example, Bitwave records a transaction from your companies wallet, and records this information on Netsuite. NetSuite then has to fit that information within the context of it's data, i.e., Debit Cash, in exchange for a Credit to Service Revenue. Then all the companies data can live on NetSuite. Then at the end of a period, the company will post their 10-K to EDGAR, and investors will speculate on the health of the company from this data.

## Problem
* This data quality is sub-optimal, for we can capture that silo'd information from the blockchain and present dashboards in real time of company 'health' if the transaction can fit within parameters, i.e., a production cycle of a good, from raw materials to end revenue. This information can be posted in real time, and we can build sub-markets for these systems of revenue that companies have.

## Example - A bakery
All companies strive to produce systems that conduct themselves.

Picture a man names Russ opens a bakery, and he makes the following purchases to create the business.

| Item   | Price |
|------------|------------|
| Building | $100,000| 
| Equipment | $30,000|
| Initial ingredients | $10,000|
| Monthly Payroll| $10,000|
| Total| $150,000|

The Balance sheet would look like:
## Assets:
| Line Item   | Value |
|------------|------------|
| Cash | $10,000| 
| Building | $100,000| 
| Equipment | $20,000|
| Raw Materials| $10,000|
| Total | $150,000|


## Liabilities:
| Line Item   | Value |
|------------|------------|
| Debt | $150,000 |

## Equity
None

This bakery in on Park avenue in New York city, and Russ just got famous on tiktok for chugging a beer outside his bakery. Business is booming.

From the 10,000 in raw materials, his was able to make $250,000 in sales. Now his balance sheet looks like this.
## Assets:
| Line Item   | Value | Note |
|:------------|:------------:|:------------|
| Cash | $260,000| 
| Building | $140,000| Building increased in value (measure at FMV for example)
| Equipment | $10,000| Depreciated quickly due to high volume
| Raw Materials| 0 | All his material is gone
| Total | $360,000|


## Liabilities:
| Line Item   | Value | Note | 
|:------------|:------------:|:------------|
| Payable to Employees | $10,000 | Due to employees for working
| Debt | $155,000 | Debt + accumulated interest
| Total | $160,000 |

## Equity
| Line Item   | Value | Note |
|:------------|:------------:|:------------|
| Equity | $200,000 | Retained Earnings from January 25


Is this a great business? Or is this a hyped up business. 

## Should Russ launch a token?
Pros:
- He can get rich
- He can get more money to expand his business

Cons:
- It could hurt image, because it would be grifty.

## Why do all tokens feel grifty?
Because there is no system behind the value being derived. Today, meme coins are built through chaos and with the launching party being able to entire control the future of a token.

It doesn't need to be this way, and I believe that we're thinking far too small on the scale for how we use tokens.

## Russ should launch a tokenized revenue token
The token shouldn't just be a meme token, it's should be programable to the system that he runs, by tying the value of his system to a speculative market value. This will create a market that rewards systems that generate value for customers and owners.

Let's take another look at the balance sheet

## Assets:
| Line Item   | Value | Note |
|:------------|:------------:|:------------|
| Cash | $260,000| USDC - ERC20
| Building | $140,000| ERC-721 Lease agreement
| Equipment | $10,000| ERC-721 Purchase agreement
| Raw Materials| 0 | ERC-1155 tokens
| Total | $360,000|


## Liabilities:
| Line Item   | Value | Note | 
|:------------|:------------:|:------------|
| Payable to Employees | $10,000 | Smart contract 
| Debt | $155,000 | LP Contract address / holding
| Total | $160,000 |

## Equity
| Line Item   | Value | Note |
|:------------|:------------:|:------------|
| Equity | $200,000 | 10% paid out to holders of $RUSS token.

# Secondary Markets for business lines
Now let's look at if we applied the same logic to a company like Starbucks. Let's move one of their small production cycles on-chain, for a new type of pastry that they going to start to offer. What if we could long or short the revenue from the system. This would create a sub-market, that could drive further revenue.

These sub-markets for business or product lines could emerge, and then these systems could be valued with higher accuracy due to the increased velocity of the market that it is a part of.

## Not a new idea, but it's only ever been possible now.
In Chris Dixon's book, Read Write Own, he makes the analogy that switching from the traditional banking system to using blockchains are akin to the world switching from constructing buildings with wood-- to building with Steel. We're able to build more. We're able to build better systems.

The new SEC Crypto 2.0 committee will likely make it clear the feasibility of tokenized sub-markets in the coming months. This will make it clear what the roadmap for building better systems will be.

## More technical paper for how I propose we build something like this
FOR NOW - I've built a prototype ERP system for launching tokens to tokenize revenue streams.

If you can build an accounting policy around a system, than that system can bring represent value by definition of the FASB. This is a truth.
